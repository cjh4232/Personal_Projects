# Projects
This repo is a collection of:
  - The code that I have created on my own as necessary tools or something for fun
  - Others' code that I have modified (with credit given)
  - Code created during learning exercises online or via books

My current projects can be broken down by language (currently only [Python](https://github.com/cjh4232/Projects/tree/main/Python) & [SQL](https://github.com/cjh4232/Projects/tree/main/SQL))
