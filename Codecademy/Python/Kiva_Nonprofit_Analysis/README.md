# Visualizing Loans Awarded by Kiva

This was a semi-guided project to learn about the Seaborn visualization library.

In this project I visualized insights using a dataset from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/fkosmowski/kivadhsv1" target = "_blank">Kaggle</a>. The dataset contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit <a href = "https://www.kiva.org/" target = "_blank">Kiva</a>. 

Using Seaborn, I explored the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts. I also visualized the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.
