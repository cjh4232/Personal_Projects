# Twitter Classification Project

These two projects were the cumulative project for the supervised learning section for machine learning

## Viral Tweet

The viral tweet project was a guided project using the K-Nearest Neighbors ML algorithm to determine if a tweet will go viral based on certain features of the tweet.
The original performance of the model was around 62% accurate, which is better than random but not great.
I'll be revisiting these in the future to attempt to improve the model's performance using more features

## Tweet Location

The tweet location project was a guided project using the Naive Bayes Classifier ML algorithm to predict if a tweet came from New York, London, or Paris.
The tweets had to be vectorized by word count before training the model.
The performance was about 68%. With more data this may be improved
