    "1. Roller coasters are thrilling amusement park rides designed to make you squeal and scream! They take you up high, drop you to the ground quickly, and sometimes even spin you upside down before returning to a stop. Today I'll be taking control back from the roller coasters and visualizing data covering international roller coaster rankings and roller coaster statistics.\n",
    "Roller coasters are often split into two main categories based on their construction material: wood or steel. Rankings for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 Golden Ticket Awards are provided in 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv' and 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv', respectively. I will load each csv into a DataFrame and inspect it to gain familiarity with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a function that will plot the ranking of a given roller coaster over time as a line. The function will take a roller coaster’s name and a ranking DataFrame as arguments.\n",
    "We'll call the function with \"El Toro\" as the roller coaster name and the wood ranking DataFrame.\n"
