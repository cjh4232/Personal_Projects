# Life Expectancy & GDP Analysis

For this project, I acted as a data researcher for the International Headquarter of Empathy And Logic (IHEAL) . I helped them analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to support their case that there is a correlation or pattern between the GDP and life expectancy of a country.

During this project, I analyzed, prepared, and plotted data, and sought to answer questions in a meaningful way.

BIG Question: Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?

GDP Source:World Banknational accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.
